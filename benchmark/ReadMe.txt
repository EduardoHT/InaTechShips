The dataset below was used to benchmark the models and ensembles. In this case, all images were moved to a test folder. If your intention is not to compare models, you can use this benchmark dataset as presented to train new detection models.

This subset can be found at the following link:

In the case of classification models, instead of the link you can use the cropped images directly from the datasetClassification folder.
